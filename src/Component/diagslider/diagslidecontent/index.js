                    of our minds. Just relax and let it flow. That easy. Let's put some happy little
                    clouds in our world. It's a very cold picture, I may have to go get my coat.
                    Itâ€™s about to freeze me to death. This is gonna be a happy little seascape.
                    Let's go up in here, and start having some fun The least little bit can do so
                    much. Work on one thing at a time. Don't get carried away - we have plenty of
                    time. Put your feelings into it, your heart, it's your world. These trees are so
                    much fun. I get started on them and I have a hard time stopping.
